To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

“If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.”

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *The Ridiculous 6  (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy  - Action hero
* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing

**Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that.

https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=594e98d9b2d574a67cdf302b8d70ef5f608c5269

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d6989e71f4fdc78062c728e573da07f1db0185a9

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e7782b8d7f25cf6e243aa243f298b8702b8955e

* It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

I cant think of what would have been enhanced if watched in 3D. those movies look beautiful and perfect in 2D.
those are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

EDIT: since a lot of people are telling me ""just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you"" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.

azonzz,movies,"[OPINION] Rich filmmakers who probably haven't paid money to go see a film in a regular modern cinema in years/decades need to stop running their mouths about ""the sanctity of the movie theater experience"" and admonishing home viewing, which is often a far purer film experience these days.","Rant forthcoming...  


No shortage of recent examples, the most prominent obviously being Spielberg's alleged attempts to get made-for-streaming films banned from the Oscars.  


To be clear right off the bat - **I love the cinema experience**. Or rather, the *ideal* cinema experience. But that's become *so rare* as to be a complete gamble these days, and very often ends up being the *shitty* cinema experience. Whereas I can watch a movie at home and *know* it's not going to get diminished or outright ruined by any number of constant social or technical problems.  


Do any of the free premieres and private screenings Spielberg attends include people browsing Instagram on their blinding white phones every 20 minutes, or unchecked kids talking or crying? Has he dealt with people constantly getting up and walking through your FOV to go to the bathroom or get snacks at *inexplicable* times during a film, breaking your immersion? Or not being able to afford to see more than one film every month or two due to increasingly ridiculous costs?  


There's also the technical issues which have become outright depressing now. 3D looks *terrible* compared to Blu-Ray - dark, blurry, thoroughly diluting of anything the cinematographer was trying to accomplish - but is often the only option available to see something depending on where you live. There are films I don't even feel like I've *seen* until watching them properly at home, because the 3D muddled things so badly. Sound has also become an issue - contrary to the idea that a home audio setup can never compete with the cinema, I've found that theater sound is absolutely pathetic these days compared to watching Netflix with a good pair of headphones, and am often straining to hear dialogue and am utterly unmoved by the weak music. The only consistent exception there is IMAX and UltraAVX which is gloriously loud, but that can be a problem too if it's, for example, a Nolan film, who for all his big talk about the theater experience is one of of the worst offenders for ruining it with his infamously shrill mixing that leaves viewers covering their ears, only able to enjoy his work in a controlled environment months later at home.  


The ""movie theater experience"" is great when it's the good version - nobody on their phones, nobody misbehaving, perfect picture and audio, within your budget, a whole audience communally having a great time being immersed in a film together. In practice however, this perfect storm of awesome happens maybe one in five times by my reckoning these days, and more often than not it's way more immersive, impressive and pure to watch a film on an HD screen with headphones, no distractions and privacy at home. So the Hollywood elite needs a reality check about the evils of watching their films on the small screen - it's often the only way to really appreciate them now."

a68vzl,movies,"If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better.","In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence.  They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   
  
On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    
  
I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     
  
I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     
  
Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.  "

cahtb1,movies,"Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan. If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing.","I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.  IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, ""with great power comes great responsibility;"" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it."

The emotions that come from a triumphant yet bittersweet ending begin to settle. And as the screen fades to black, and you feel the catharsis that comes from watching an epic film take hold....

A bright title card for Suits comes up.

Who has ever finished a film and on finishing it clicks the recommended film straight away?  And yet the ads come up, every single time. It completely ruins the moment. And yes, you can click the box to continue watching the credits- but why should we even have to do that? Why is it so hard for Netflix to not promote their material for five minutes after a film ends?

In a life bombarded by advertisements do we have to be shown another one the second a film finishes? Is there no respite? 

From what I've seen online there isn't a way to disable this specific feature (though I would really love to be proven wrong on this one).

Anyway, rant over."

45sul3,movies,"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?","I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is ""they make less money"" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. 

EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here. "

Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

eh71gy,movies,I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking.,"This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Dumbo - 5/10** 

**All Is True - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

7jsyqt,announcements,"The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating, but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.","Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that we’re going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

u\/arabscarab \(Jessica, our head of policy\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. 

—u\/spez & u\/kn0thing

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3–2."

While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House in order for the rules to be fully restored, this is still an incredibly important step in that process—one that could not have happened without all your phone calls, emails, and [other activism](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/). The [evidence](http://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Net_Neutrality_II_Slides_041818.pdf) is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties \(or no party at all\), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting. 

We’re going to keep working with you all on this in the coming months, but for now, we just wanted to say thanks!"

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

Don't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.

ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

An example: To Kill a Mockingbird. I've been trying to catch up on some classics and this book was not taught in my high school and surprisingly, I know very little about its plot. It's back cover and Goodreads synopsis is nothing but praise and I don't to ruin it by reading the Wikipedia plot.

muule5,books,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. 

If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. 

Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. 

What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.

""Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.""  

""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.  

""Ah."" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. ""What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me."""

7669xp,books,I feel like an idiot. I vastly misunderstood how a library card works for years.,"So, I was talking to my wife and the subject came to library cards and how she had one. I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

This is a complete game changer and I feel so foolish for not realizing this sooner!"

I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing. 

I'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping.

Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.

&#x200B;

I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   


Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.

&#x200B;

So, without further ado, here are my top 15:

&#x200B;

1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud ""NO NO no no no no no no..."" at one point and had to put it down for the day.
2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.
3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.
4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.
5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.
6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is ""I'm sorry, I'm too late"" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.
7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  
8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.
9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.
10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.
11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.
12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.
13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.
14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. 
15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.

**Honorable Mentions:** Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters

&#x200B;

Yes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  


Anyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.


Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it’s even science fiction.

Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.

Edit3: All right, all right, I'll join GoodReads. My username is morbowillcrushyou, feel free to add me!"

m98xyh,books,"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone","It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.

Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than ""in love"". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.

Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.

As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.

Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: ""For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...""

Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.

Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.

&#x200B;

Edit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.

&#x200B;

Edit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.

&#x200B;

Edit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it. "
e1gs2c,books,Small bookstores are booming after nearly being wiped out,
dhgug9,books,"10 years ago I was the type of person to always have a book in their hand, on their nightstand, in their bag - I was reading upwards of 20+ books a year. Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. 

I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. 

But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. 

Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

ayrfyg,books,I finally had the realization that it's ok to stop reading a book that you aren't enjoying.,"I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.

Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

glberg,books,I never realised that losing my love for reading was a sign of depression.,"Recently I have started trying to get back into reading. I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. 

I always told myself “I’m just too stressed with school”, “oh I’m just in a reading slump I’ll come out of it soon”, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. 

It wasn’t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. 

She said “oh you’re turning into me”. 

I wasn’t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn’t a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I’m somewhat on the uphill, I’m finding my footing in the reading world again.

Edit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. 

We are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. 

My goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life."

lrsy8i,books,Rant here but I hate when books use movie posters as their cover art.,"It's one of my biggest pet peeves. I love beautiful cover art on books and I hate to say I do judge a book by its cover. There's this book I want its a Swedish horror novel and every single copy I can find the cover is a still from the movie adaption. I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don't want a film poster on it. I almost don't even want to get the book. I've seen this trend happen with a lot books that turned into movies and frankly I don't care that it's a movie. I'm here for the book! I don't want to see the movie cover I want to see the original book cover. I love how unique book cover art can be and I feel like slapping the movie poster on every new copy does the book a slight disservice. I know im sounding like a cover snob and  I know there's more to books than the book cover but I cant help but being annoyed when it's all I can find for new copies.

Edit: on a happier note here's some of my favorite book covers.

Edit 3: I appreciate every single one of you!! I also appreciate all this new info I learned about why movie covers are so important including some personal stories I read. I haven't been able to reply to everyone but I've been reading through all your comments! I know I was being over dramatic here and I still wish with certain books it wasn't so hard or expensive to get their original books ( Im looking at you ""Let The Right One In"" ). But as someone who has always been passionate about writing and reading I can't ignore the fact that movie covers helps the book industry and authors. So for that I'm super grateful! Anyways I just want to say I love you all here and thanks for educating me on the importance of them❤ I also want to say it was so fun seeing all you passionate readers here it warms my little heart."

Edit #2: how the fuck did this happen

Edit #3: I want to take this opportunity to say a few things about borderline. Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.

ERS people can and often are insufferable  under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.

 It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.

 It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.

Final update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable. I'm about 70% done with the edits I was given and then....man, who knows.

Thanks for everything Reddit. You made me feel amazing and increased my chances ten fold. I love you all, truly."
lhhtyh,books,Atlas Shrugged is a terrible book,"I've noted this many times before: I've played [Bioshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock) which I've found amazing and heard it was based on [Atlas Shrugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged). ""Wow"", I though, ""this AMAZING game is based on a book, must be doubly amazing, I must read it!""

Oh no, and so I have. Atlas Shrugged is a **terrible** book. It reads like fanfic. Atlas Shrugged is like ""50 shades of gray"", but for the economy.

It's a long winded love letter to capitalism, with engineers and CEOs being by far the smartest, purest and best beings on our Earth, basically Disney princesses in suits, with doves landing  on their lapels and everything.

Being an inventor or a capitalist basically means you're the world champion of philosophy, limbo and sex.

This goes for women too! Well, A woman who's equal to them in every way, except when she gets horny and requires a good tending to, you know, like a silly woman does. But only by her intellectually and entrepreneurial equal, can't have some schmo with no patents to his name caress your snow-white complexion with his rough inventor hands, looking at you with steely blue eyes.

The grand finale is some guy reading out a manifesto on a radio or something to the entire Earth, everybody sits and listens in silence for hours because that's what 80 pages of it felt like.

Why is Atlas Shrugged so revered?

**Edit:** half of the comments answer it's not revered at all, the other half are calling me an idiot for not understanding its majesty.

It's not a book about economy or capitalism because they don't work even close to what the book describes, the version of capitalism and social dynamics outlined in the book is the ""Saturday morning cartoon"" version at best."

It is one of those books that actually makes you think and not the one that thinks for you. The quote “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” will always stay with me.

What quote/scene from To Kill A Mockingbird is unforgettable for you?

EDIT: Just to be clear, when I said “60 years ago, Harper Lee was already advocating for Black Lives Matter” I didn’t mean to single-out every person who had been fighting for it since day 1 or that it was Lee who first fought for it. This is my first time to actually get this tons of upvotes here on Reddit and I’m just surprised how some people could easily misinterpret what you genuinely mean. 

On the other hand, I truly appreciate all the recommendations which people said to be better representations of the long fight against systemic racism than TKAM. I’ll definitely check them out.

Lastly, a lot of you were saying that if I loved TKAM that much, don’t even bother reading “Go Set A Watchman” because it’ll definitely ruin the former for me and the characters I’ve learned to love. Well, if I’m being honest here, that makes me want to read it even more. I guess I will have to see it for myself in order to fully grasp and understand where people are coming from. Also, people were saying the latter was a product of exploitation and actually the first draft of TKAM which publishers rejected hence I shouldn’t really see it as a sequel. But I beg to differ, why can’t we just see it as a study of how the novel we know and love that is TKAM came to be and how Harper Lee’s idea evolved and changed instead of seeing it as a separate novel?"

It's quite sad when I think about it given how much I love reading and even have a library in my house. What makes it worse was the last book I read was rubbish, I didn't really enjoy it at all but read it as I don't like leaving books half started. It was 'How Not to Die Alone' by Richard Roper. Had I have known I might have re-read an old favourite or tried a random new genre. I've never tried audiobooks, and I know there is a debate as to if it constitutes reading, but for me it's going to have to be the way forwards."

As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

Edit: Well shit, it's spelled ""Morgenstern."" Ty for the solidarity those who have fallen for sneaky Goldman also. We stand in our united in our gullibility."
rsyjml,books,Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago,"So I'm reading *Discworld* for the first time (yes I know, quite late to the party on this), enjoying it so far, but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor. I thought I'd share it here because it shows that this kind of thing has been prevalent in fantasy (and to be fair, many other kinds of) literature for a long time now.

From *The Light Fantastic* (I don't think this counts as a spoiler since it doesn't give away any of the plot, mods please let me know if I'm wrong):

> ...this particular hero was a heroine. A redheaded one.

> Now, there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one's shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at length about leather, thighboots and naked blades.

> Words like ""full,"" ""round"" and even ""pert"" creep into the narrative, until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down.

> Which is all rather silly, because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword isn't about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer.

And then Pratchett does communicate that this character is attractive, but he does so almost grudgingly, as though it's some kind of concession to the reader:

> Oh well, all right. The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling's Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chainmail, soft boots and a short sword.

> All right, maybe the boots were leather. But not black.

This book was published in 1986, so this was an interesting (and funny) glimpse into the fact that the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy (which still persists today) has been around for a long time."

wlrpr6,books,"Currently reading Jennette McCurdy's memoir ""I'm Glad My Mom Died"". I was expecting it to be interesting - I'm blown away.","There's been a lot of hype for this book, so I was expecting a more-so-than-normal interesting celebrity memoir, but what I'm reading goes so far and beyond what I expected. The subject matter itself has been talked about to death by now in the news cycle and on Reddit so I won't go into that too much - you know what you're getting into here. Instead, I wanna talk about the rest of what her book is about.

Jennette has a distinct writing voice and we learn quickly that she always wanted to be a writer since it was the one part of her life she had any control over, to the point where she wrote whole screenplays just for herself which she shared with her mother (the titular, *ahem*, well... you all know at this point).

This book has completely changed my perspective not only on iCarly (I don't know if I could honestly ever watch it again and be able to enjoy it in the same way after this), but child stardom in Hollywood in general. The abuse she went through as a child went far beyond whatever you're expecting to the point where you will probably be shocked by how underdeveloped and naive she was even at the age of 18. There are genuinely moments where I wanted to put the book down because it got so uncomfortable to read but it was so engrossing and affective, so *honest* that I burnt through half the book in just a few hours.

I know it's sold out in so many places already, but I highly, highly recommend any 90s/00s Nickelodeon fans to pick this one up (or download the Ebook) if you can. She's also working on a novel right now and I can say with confidence as I read this that I'll be checking it out.

Also just want to add that I have an incredible respect for Miranda Cosgrove now, more than I would've expected, and the chapters dealing with their initial friendship are particularly interesting when you juxtapose them with their characters from iCarly - almost a role-reversal in the real world."
6qxh4l,books,I've had a problem with this sub for a while. Does anyone agree?,"Hello,

I’ve been posting on r/books for a few years now, and while I have enjoyed a lot of the interactions and discussions I’ve had, there’s something about the sub that is really starting to bug me. Maybe some of you feel the same.

I was reading a post yesterday, where the OP (16 years old) was asking for recommendations about more ‘mature’ books. He enjoyed reading YA and stuff, but wondered what else was out there. When someone asked him why he would want to do this, OP said something along the lines of he felt ‘ashamed’ to still be reading these kinds of books.

Someone downvoted him for it. Similarly, looking down the thread I could see that many people who had offered recommendations about mature books had been down voted. I then started thinking about threads that I have commented on. There has been so many times where I have tried to contribute thoughtfully to a discussion – just like the 16 year old OP - but because others didn’t agree, I’ve been downvoted.

I can’t be the only person to have noticed this trend, and it’s a bummer. r/books is a place where we *discuss* and share opinions about the thing we love most of all – books. It should be a place where we can get inspiration and, hopefully, learn about writers that ordinarily would have passed us by. But instead, I feel like there are a lot of people here that treat the place as a zero-sum game, where they are ‘right’ and you are ‘wrong’ – and downvote accordingly. *You don’t like my favourite book?* - Downvote. *You explain why in a thoughtful, polite manner that encourages further discussion?* - Fuck you. Downvote. The more this trend continues, the more the sub declines until all that’s left are people jealously guarding their opinions, unable to hear those of others over the roar of their internal rage.

I mean, I try and my bit to combat this. I don’t downvote other people’s opinions, even if they are very different from my own, and I do this because that’s not what the function is for. The sidebar: *It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion […] in a safe, supportive environment.* I save the downvotes for people who break these rules - the trolls and dickheads spewing racism.

Which isn’t to say I’m perfect – I’ve got into some heated arguments on here and said some stuff I’ve regretted, but in those instances I’ve tried to apologise because after I’d calmed down, I realised that while we all have different personal tastes – they are just that: personal tastes. They are not objective. In the same way, r/books frustrates me sometimes in how it’s focused on the same books (Hitchhikers, TLoTR, Pratchett, Gaiman etc.), but I don’t downvote these threads or the people commenting on them, because this is a place where people should be allowed to discuss their passions without getting blue-arrowed. 

The world is full of people screaming at each other with their fingers in their ears. r/books doesn’t have to become another such place.

I have a feeling I’m opening myself up to a world of hurt with this post, but fuck it – I care about the sub, and want to see it thrive.

kfjwug,books,Ever catch yourself simply reading the words on a page without even digesting any of them?,"My initial reaction was to attribute it to the pernicious impact of digitalization and how it's basically eradicated my attention span (which I'm desperately attempting to rebuild by reading and reducing my time imbibing immediately gratifying content online) - however the more I think about it -  it's probably also my mild OCD, anxiety, ADHD etc doing it's thing.

Very rarely can I actually get immersed in a book, oftentimes I feel like Ron Burgundy who spoils humorous moments by bluntly remarking 'we are laughing!' - but in the context of reading I'm sitting there scanning the words thinking 'wow would you look at me reading Dostoevsky. Quite the learned individual aren't I.' and I sometimes go into a fuckin weird inner monologue that ends with a David Mitchel rant 'words don't really exist do they, they're just a collection of squiggly lines that someone gave meaning to...look at how stupid that one looks'.

It sounds a bit amusing but it's really fuckin frustrating.

Then there's the ambience of the room and external distractions, the discomfort of holding the book open, my itchy ass, not wanting to crease the spine of the book too much blah blah... I'm just disappointed with myself for struggling so much to read. I went years without much reading, and I was expecting some challenge upon returning to it, but not to this level.

Has anyone had similar experiences?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** 

Well It appears that I'm not alone in this issue... I'm not too sure if this should come as a relief or not...

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** 

For the record I wasn't trying to be a pretentious bastard with my writing. If it came across that way it's because I actually went on a crusade to learn every word in the English language over half a decade or so  - I've forgotten most of them but occasionally an obscure word will slip into my writing because it's actually the first word that sprung to mind, not because I was looking up rare synonyms on [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) to prove how intelofgent I am.  

I have had a bit of fun calling girls pulchritudinous and watching them got offended before discovering the meaning of it, but overall it's been a waste of time and all it's really done is get me mislabelled as being a pompous prick when I'm not trying to be. "

It should be a must read in school and shows key economic problems (e.g. economic inequality, affordable education etc). and facist tatics which should be dealt with to maintain healthy democracies and identify extremist politicians.

Edit: Wow this blew up more than i expected! Through the discussion i had so far I have to admit that reading only a book from one point of view is in some way political indoctrination if the book is not sufficiently cricitally analyzed and discussed in class which is difficult as teachers may not be completely umbiased. Thus a book covering opposing views should be covered aswell to provide a full overview. However, all in all i believe reading these books are better at giving an understanding of these forms of governance  than just plain theory, films or fictional books.

It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate. 

 I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up: 

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""

Found the Kindle App with the Open Dyslexic font and have read 13 books since June!,"I started with the Harry Potter series I so desperately wanted to read as a child and flew through them. I always loved books but found reading through the same page 4-5 times daunting. With this font paired with the dark mode option, I’ve even read an entire 345 book in one day! 

Dyslexia prevented me from fully absorbing the material. Now I’m whisked away to whichever world I choose. I never thought I’d ever be able to enjoy reading as I do now. I’m incredibly grateful.

**EDIT: Sorry guys, it gets really busy at 6 am! 

I am aware that audiobooks exist. I listen to people talk all day. I can’t listen to two people at once. I’ve tried them and I don’t enjoy them. 

There are absolutely studies that show the font DOES NOT help you to read faster, more accurately, or even help at all. This is NOT a remedy for dyslexia.

I’m NOT advertising the font as a cure all. Just stating that with MY Dyslexia it helps ME feel more comfortable. I misread words, skip over entire paragraphs, lose my place frequently, flip letters that look similar, mirror simple words, all the good stuff. I can read and read and read the same page and still feel like I don’t understand. 

Theres also more than one form of dyslexia. What makes me feel comfortable might not be comfortable for others. Is it a placebo? Probably! Is a placebo that’s made me more confident while reading? Absolutely. And I’m stil happy with that. 

What helps ME to feel more comfortable while reading is the spacing. 

“Venice &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cats.” 
“Venice is a city of cats.”

Thicker bottoms and lines on the letters/longer  “tails” help me a little bit with flipping and keeping my place. I feel like don’t fixate as long as a did after I grew comfortable with the font. My font size is pretty large as well. I’m a die hard Helvetica fan but I’ve grown to like this more while reading long passages.

Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”"

Here's the intro:","We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

edit: Woke up in the middle of the night to my dog jumping on my bed and licking his crotch and saw this post blowing up. Glad to see it resonates with so many beyond myself. I would also like to plug Infinite Jest and DFW's work in general, one of the reasons I found Neil Postman. Infinite Jest is about a Huxley-an dystopian future where advertisers buy the rights to name years, therapy tries to get you to release your inner infant, and a wheelchair-bound group of assassins tries to destabilize the world by disseminating a video that is so entertaining you desire nothing else in life but to watch it. A little verbose(lol) but imo worth every word."

They mention that they ""read"" the book, and there are a *lot* of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn't ""read"" the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to ""read"" a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn't that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.

There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they've read, then they need to read more books. There's no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.

Stop gatekeeping ""reading"" or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as ""reading"" does not harm you in anyway.

EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn't matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That's really all that matters. Also, when I see these comments, they usually include or imply some kind of value-judgment, so they aren't just comments on semantics."

gv7kts,books,Friendly reminder that YA books are for teenagers.,"Now before you jump on me, this is not an adults can't read YA post. This is a adults who read YA need to remember who YA is for post. 

I've been floating around the arc (advanced reader copy) circuit for a while. Read some good stuff, read some bad, read some meh. This past weekend I had the privilege of reading one of the best books I've had the privilege of reading in a long time. YA fantasy that was beautifully written and equal parts dark, funny and suspenseful. The teenaged characters acted authentically like teenagers, which unfortunately is incredibly rare in YA. 

Edit: For those who are interested, the book is Remnants of Atonement by G.P McKenna. It doesn't release until October, so likely only available through netgalley, but if you have an account and enjoy ya fantasy, I highly recommend requesting it. 

Today I logged on to leave my feedback and thought I would nosey around in the reviews, only for my heart to sink. Everybody seemed to agree the plot was good and the writing was fantastic, but so many people were complaining that the characters acted too much like teenagers. One reviewer even praised the plot but only gave it one star because ""it was too obvious that the characters were 15/16 years old and that annoyed me.""

Again, these are YA books. They are intended for teenaged readers. If you enjoy reading them too, that's great, but understand that. If you find teenagers annoying, go read literally anything else. You have the rest of the book store, the rest of the library. Don't complain that the 16 year old character acts too much like a 16 year old because what happens then is -because as adults we have the money - the market will continue to push YA characters who are 35 year old accountants stuck in the body of a 17 year old assassin. The list of books teenagers can relate to goes down, isolating them from their own catagory. 

Long story short, let teenagers read teenaged characters who act like teenagers. Stop isolating real life teenagers by appropriating the ya catagory when you have every other book to choose from if you don't like the teenaged voice. Support young readers by letting ya characters be kids!"

Too many relationship counselors offering their services for free tonight when their generosity is not actually needed. 
—————————————————————————————

So, I’m going to gripe about it here. 

First off, who is this book even for? It reads like it’s written for middle schoolers, but everything revolves around 80’s references that they wouldn’t understand. I feel like I’m too old to for the book yet I’m a 90’s kid (born late 80’s). 

Second, let me talk more about the terrible writing. Nothing is implied in this book and the reader discovers nothing. Aunt and aunt’s boyfriend = bad people 🙁Wade = super clever and righteous 😊 Samantha = sassy and smart 😉 and Sorrento = EVIL! The characters have no nuances whatsoever. The only interesting character development was Aech actually being a chubby black girl, but from I hear about Ready Player Two (more on that later), it just doesn’t go anywhere. Overall, it reads like a book for 13-year-olds, but I just don’t feel like it was intended to be directed at 13-year-olds...?

Third, the “love” story between Wade and Samantha is cheesy, forced, and kind of misogynistic. Like, I thought that he’d realize that he doesn’t actually love her, he’s just crushing really hard. Maybe she’d help him understand that by saying how they haven’t even met and he doesn’t actually know her. To be fair, she tried a little bit, but her main argument was, “you don’t love me because you don’t know that I’m actually ugly!” What the fuck? The author can tell me that Wade loves her for who she really is and doesn’t care about her looks, but everything always ends up coming back around to her looks anyway. And she falls for him in the end! Why? This relationship makes no goddamn sense. It especially makes no sense because even though she’s way better at the Hunt than he is (sans playing playing a few classic arcade games), Wade still somehow becomes her white knight in shining armor. It’s gross and I hate it, and I’m a dude. Also, I can’t even begin to process how ridiculous a lot of the plot points are, like IOI not being able to beat 4 kids with their team of scholars. Wade even discovers how much info they have on Halliday, and not one person on their team, who have more information than Wade, could figure out the stuff he did?

I’m here to rant and say what I can’t to my friend so I’ll be done now, but I’ll make one comment on Ready Player Two. I just got it from the library, read the prologue and immediately returned it after spending a minute reading about Wade eating fruit.

Edit: Did the kid even give one solitary fuck that his home was blown up and his family murdered? I mean, he almost got killed as well."

How badly could it affect your bottom line to use plastic stickers that come off clean?

I found 6 of the Chronicles of Narnia books at a bookstore once and got the missing one from Abe Books a few years ago and it came with a sticker on the spine, making the set not really a set. I contacted their customer service just to say, ""Hey, not sure if anyone has said this but the janky stickers kind of harm the product."" They gave me a refund but I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the title of Prince Caspian to be visible when it's on the damn shelf!

Booksellers at Barnes & Noble are really suffering right now. Other than the usual frustrations of being booksellers in the year 2021 we have also been the subject of constant abuse from customers. All we’re asking is please be patient with us. Here are somethings t be aware of and please spread the word:
1) if we could have every book ever made in stores we would. We’re not Amazon, we can’t have dozens of every small press title ready to go and in your hand in two days. 
2) Shipping delays have affected us too. We want your order to come ASAP but we don’t control the shipping lines or the warehouses and we’re not given any real means of tracking your order either. 
3) we’re short short staffed. Like everywhere else. We’re paid minimum wage and people are going anywhere else quoting after two weeks and they can’t even hold onto managers. We’re doing our best but a lot of us are new and still getting used to the job and we don’t have a lot of backup for when we get busy. Please have patience with us.

So many of us have been reduced to absolute tears the past few weeks from customers yelling at us. Throwing books around and just the stress of each person trying to the job of three or more. We love books and love bringing those joys to people but we definitely need help and support during these trying times.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your massive outpouring of support. It’s incredibly heartening. This account was made from a group of us just wanting to get our experiences out there and it quickly changed the mood of our night. We hope that perhaps some word of this makes it to someone with the power to make a difference."

This is just me though, that’s how I felt about it but i’m sure many students out there probably feel the same. Let me tell you, read those books. I’m currently a college senior, and only recently started reading for leisure. The emotions that these books evoke while i’m reading is truly amazing, to the point where I find myself lying the book on my chest and relishing the messages that just pop out of the page. Books are a tool used to deepen ourselves and change the way we see the world around us, the authors of the past have so many great insights that I wish I appreciated earlier in my academic and personal life. Just do yourself a favor and read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, Sinclair, etc.

EDIT: Hey guys, after reading many of your comments, I realized I may have come off a bit strong in pushing what’s assigned to us in school. However, that wasn’t truly my intention. What I more or less meant to say is you should give the assigned readings a chance, because we may often overlook some good pieces of literature. With that, “try to read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, and Sinclair.” Also, I have nothing wrong with spark-notes, I shouldn’t have made that title. Spark-notes is a wonderful resource that definitely helps us better understand some really difficult reading material, but it should be a supplement and if you’re really really not enjoying the book, just spark-note the dang thing!"

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""

My last 5 star book that I can't stop raving about is **The Rabbit Yard** by Johannes Anyuru. It's very topical as it starts with an act of terrorism.

6mf2a8,books,The Animorphs were a lot darker than what you possibly remember as a kid,"Here are some of the spoilers you missed out on by not reading Animorphs:

Five children are forced to engage in guerilla warfare, espionage and repeated murder to protect their loved ones from alien parasites as they wait for the other, heroic aliens to finally arrive.



 When they do, the “good” aliens turn out to not give a shit about humans, caused the whole intergalactic war through their own shittiness and are willing to exterminate whole planets themselves to get at their hated enemies.


A child repeatedly experiences his intestines hanging out of his body while in various animal forms


A child is mentally tortured until broken and never gets better

A child in the form of a fly experiences getting splattered and smeared against a ceiling until his friends who are also flies at the time can peel his body off and take him somewhere he can transform back into a whole human before his insect mind fades completely


A child is shrunken and experiences having her eyeballs digested out of her head inside her friend’s stomach while she’s in the form of a tiny elephant


The heroes are forced to permanently imprison another child in the body of a rat because he knows too much and they abandon him on a tiny island with only other rats and garbage for company.


 Rumors circulate that the island is haunted but it’s actually his psychic screams reaching distant boaters.


A race of devastatingly powerful, violent aliens turn out to be mental toddlers who don’t know what they’re doing and are just bred to think they’re playing one big game before they’re killed at age three so they don’t learn the truth


An alien spends a few centuries hanging from the parasitic tentacle of a much bigger alien, surrounded by millions of rotting corpses attached to its other moon-spanning tendrils. They engage in mental warfare until one finally absorbs the other completely.



It turns out another seemingly “evil” alien race is simply driven to kill and eat everything in sight because it was separated from its original world where food was continuous and the entire specie’s life is the torture of perpetual starvation


A peaceful robot willingly removes its inhibition against violence to help in the war, only to slaughter a huge number of alien-controlled humans so gruesomely that nobody dares think about or speak of it again and it is the only thing left undescribed in a book series that already describes entrails getting torn out and skulls getting smashed


A child stays too long in the form of a flea and instead of turning back into a human, accidentally turns momentarily into one big, giant flea that can only writhe and moan because it shouldn’t exist and can’t live at that scale.


The kids discover Atlantis, then discover that Atlanteans are inbred mutants who paralyze any humans they find, dissect them alive to figure out how their organs work, then stuff the corpses as kitschy museum displays for their children.


An ordinary ant gets transformed into a human child. It has no idea what’s happening and is so overwhelmed by its huge new brain and sensory input that it can only scream until it dies

Just google up your local library. Sign up for a card. They email you your card number and you can sign in and start loading up. This has saved me hundreds of dollars every year.


Edit: I am not trying to tell people to give up their audible. If you like it and it works for you, that’s great! But some people don’t have cash to spend on little luxuries like that and supporting your

I don’t know why it hit me. I’ve seen that kind of motivational shit spread around all the time, but just the simple way such a harsh truth was worded so succinctly and the way it related to that point of the story really made me think. I struggle with a relatively mild bit of depression, and a lot of the time I struggle to even leave my bed because what’s the point? It feels like anything I try to do is just gonna fail anyway. I think reading that quote was just what I needed at this exact time. Life can be shitty, and a lot of the time you don’t get the things you want, but you still have to be courageous and at least try a little. I guess I’d kinda lost sight of that until now."

-offering discounted entry to local museums/attractions

-holding educational/arts events for kids/teens/adults

-holding (free) small concerts for local musicians

-lending books between themselves to offer a greater catalogue to residents

-endless magazine and newspaper subscriptions

n11u0f,books,"Teacher claims that fantasy isn't ""Literature""","Okay, so I'm a high-school student in the Netherlands. I got back into reading just a couple of months ago and I read a lot of fantasy in English (currently reading mistborn). A few days ago, I was interested in seeing if there are any fantasy classics from the Netherlands. So I looked up online, to see if there is some kind of ""Dutch Tolkien"". I couldn't find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a ""Dutch Tolkien"". She told me bluntly that I shouldn't read fantasy and that she doesn't consider it to be ""real literature"". She basically thinks that Tolkien's books aren't ""real literature"".

That teacher is one of the biggest gatekeepers I know. She keeps rambling about how sad it is that kids don't read much anymore and then she literally claims that certain genres shouldn't be read. She's also one of those people who say that listening to audiobooks doesn't count as reading.

Well I'm just gonna keep reading my ""not real literature"" and my teacher can continue being an ignorant gatekeeper.

Edit: I wrote this post during my lunchbreak so I didn't have any time to respond to the comments since I was in class all this time. I'm going to discuss many of the points you guys brought up here with my teacher and I hope that I can convince her to perhaps change her views regarding fantasy.

I also didn't expect so many comments so my post isn't as nuanced as it probably should be. I wrote it right after asking her and this post became more of a rant than I intended. I don't actually think that the teacher is an idiot, but she is unfortunately very close minded.

*Keep in mind that she teaches Dutch literature in high school. I see many comments of people in the Netherlands or Belgium who have had the same experience with Dutch literature teachers, so this might be some form of Dutch snobbery or maybe it just has to do with the fact that the fantasy genre is very uncommon in literature here, so she thinks that it's only for kids. Either way, I would've expected her to be less of a gatekeeper and more of a teacher.*

To clarify about audiobooks: in Dutch schools you are required to choose a list 12 Dutch classic novels that you have to read in your 3 years of high school (if you do vwo). My teacher doesn't allow us to listen to any of these books on our list in audiobook format, because ""it's not reading"".

Another edit: wow this blew up and got way more upvotes and comments than I expected. Also thanks for all the great (Dutch fantasy) book recommendations. Apparently these kind of posts get posted very often, so I'm sorry for accidentaly making such a generic post while ranting about my Dutch teacher lol. "

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS— Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

If anybody is keenly interested in biological sciences, this is a book for them. It'll make you 'scared-to-death' (spoiler?).

On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was available for free.  I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.

Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.

As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.

HOWEVER, I am a Chinese girl with a Chinese name - I grew up in England, and my sister and I were the only Chinese kids at our school. Cho Chang was the first Chinese character I encountered whilst reading. I felt seen. Her name, and even the fact that she was the only Chinese girl (that I knew of) at Hogwarts, resonated with me. I also think this reflects the time in which JK Rowling wrote the books: there just wasn’t as many Chinese people in the country as there are now.

Of course the shoppers will cancel their order, but more than likely they will already have your Name, Address, & Phone #, which is what the scam sets out to accomplish. 

I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident and reported the seller. They sent me a swift response and even credited $5 for my trouble. So today I am browsing for books again and lo and behold, a different seller name has a great price, same situation.

**Notes:**

\- They've only released 8 lists thus far, starting in 2014 and ending in 2020, with one year having two ""official"" list releases. I put this data together months ago, so I'm a bit hazy on the reason, but one of those two lists seemed to make far more sense to me at the time as the true list, so I just chose that one and disregarded the alternate list.

\- I hope the intro is understandable, but in case it's confusing: If a book appeared in at least 5 of 7 yearly lists, it is not penalized/lowered in rank for not appearing in the other 1 or 2. But books with 4 or less appearances are always ranked lower than books that appeared more often, even if they ranked higher on average. The number 5 may seem arbitrary, but I had to have some system to avoid outliers and that made the most sense to me.

\- The genres and page counts are shoddy. I wanted that aspect of the list to be simple so I just had one figure for each, and of course you can find a ton of different figures online. The page counts are primarily B&N, and the genres are primarily Wikipedia.

**Observations:**

\- Books by American authors appear more than twice as often as any other nationality, with 29 occurrences. Then, English with 14, Russian with 11, French with 9, and Irish with 7. 61 books are from Europe, 4 from South America, and 2 from Asia (excluding the Bible, and Russian literature since it is usually grouped separately). Nearly half of the Russian novels appear in the top 20, though - their five novels in the top 20 fall just short of the 6 American novels in the top 20.

\- 4chan validates its reputation somewhat, as the list only features three female authors, one being JK Rowling. Notable authors like Jane Austen and Mary Shelley are absent. Virginia Woolf does have two submissions though.

nnc2h4,books,I hate when it’s obvious authors didn’t do basic research and it really kills the mood.,"I was reading “The Perfect Marriage” by Adam Mitzner and there was a moment that made me say that’s not even close to correct. A lawyer was speaking to a character explaining a charge and said: 

“Murder in the second, which is the most serious charge for murder that is premeditated but not involving a police officer.” 

And it completely took me out of the situation because I immediately went no that’s not how that works. 2nd is typically NOT premeditated which is its main distinguishing factor from 1st. The involvement of a police officer does not have any bearing on it at all. Unless I’m severely mistaken, but I don’t think I am.

Has this happened to any of you where you’ve seen something obviously wrong and it just kills the mood for you?

EDIT: apparently in NY where this book is set saves 1st degree murder for really specific circumstances and then labels all other premeditated murder as 2nd so I was mistaken. I googled second degree murder premeditation before posting to confirm what I thought and all the links I got told me I was right and that premeditation made the charge first degree. I did not think to try googling NY 2nd degree, because I didn’t realize there would be a difference. I guess I suffered from confirmation bias on this one. Thanks to you guys who picked up on it!

EDIT 2: Yes I was wrong. Yes that makes this post an irony. But I won’t delete it. It’s interesting seeing the discussions you’re all having and at the end of the day it’s better to just admit I was wrong then try and hide it.

EDIT 3: I never thought this many ppl would see this post. The egg on my face is thoroughly cooked and my tummy is full of crow. A lot of you have been kind about my error and some of you have not. You reading this are allowed to be wrong. You’re allowed to not know everything. You just need to own up to it when you’re called on it and learn from it. Even if that mistake might be seen by a crap ton of ppl on the internet. My apologies to Adam Mitzner."

The Book has such warmth, such love for family, and Jack's struggle. Danny is a complex character, as is Wendy.  None of the actual scary spooky monster stuff happens until near the end...and that's brilliant. 

I know this book was near and dear to King due to his own drinking problems.  I also know authors sometimes tend to get a little heated about adaptions and it's overblown sometimes. Not in this case.

Kubrics movie, while an enjoyable watch, has lost all flavor to me after reading the book. It's liked someone ready a summary and bullet point presentation, but missed the entire point.

I finally decided to read it after watching Doctor Sleep and loving it.  Decided to read them both. I know Kings books are often pretty different than their TV or Movie Adaptions, but this one...wow.  It feels so shallow now. Jack in the movie feels crazy from the start, ready to murder his own family at the drop of a hat.

In the book, his struggle is so heartwrenching.  His desire to be a better man. To resist the hotel. Seeing him ultimately lose in the end, knowing it was coming because of the movie and Dr.Sleep of course, I still was like ""Please don't do it Jack, resist!"", I couldn't help myself.

It really touched me on an emotional level, Jacks internal monologues.  I don't drink or have kids, but it resonated with me so strongly, the feeling put into those.

Instead Kubrick made it a generic horror movie."

[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE) PS: the link works best in browser, not thru a mobile app! 

**Science Fiction**: 

*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good ""alien"" or ""first contact"" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. 

*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. 

*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

**Fiction**:

*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel ""Secret History"", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to ""start fresh"" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. 

*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. 

**Non-Fiction**:

*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. 

*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary ""Restrepo"" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. 

*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. 

*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

**Science**:

*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method ""CRISPR"" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. 

*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. 

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. 

**History**:

*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. 

*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think ""bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake"" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. 

*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. 


**Books that live up to the hype**:

*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. 

*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. 

*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

*The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book ""Recursion"" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

**Overall favorite book**:

*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. 


I should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE). Feel free to ask me about any single one of them, I remember them perfectly and will to respond to everyone :)"

I reward myself for a hard day of work by coming home and browsing the little rectangle while the big rectangle plays in the background, and perhaps using the medium rectangle to inject dopamine points into my eyeballs with video games for an hour or so.

My parents were for whatever reason a little slow to allow me my first smartphone (I had a flip phone until about 2012). I was a quiet, well behaved, and very obviously outwardly depressed student, so most of my teachers would let me either sleep (during periods 1, 2, and either 4 or 5 depending on which one was immediately after lunch) or read in the back of class (during periods 3, 4, and 6) because I was doing well on all my tests anyway. 

(I also just want to take a second to say fuck high school schedules. I was and am a natural 3-11 sleeper like a lot of high schoolers were, and having to get up at 6:30 to go to learning jail should be against the Geneva Convention)

Reading used to be my escape, man! I remember when Inheritance came out and I was so stoked for it and I finished it in like 3 days. It was so immersive and I would often maladaptively daydream that I was in the book doing something awesome.

What happened? Now I can't go more than 5 minutes without my hand instinctively reaching for the Reddit or Facebook button. I know because I uninstalled them, and so my reflex would happen and I would find myself staring at a blank page wondering what I even got out my phone to do.

It was one of the best experiences of my life.,"I've been waiting to read The Hobbit to my son since he was born but I had to wait until he was old enough to appreciate it. It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim. 

We finished last night and today I overheard my son singing the Misty Mountain song (I got several requests to repeat that part and I was able to sing it well thanks to YouTube). That experience brought us closer together and it warms my heart to know how much he appreciated our Hobbit time each night.

An unexpected journey, indeed!"

tq8spe,books,"Ender's Game seems like the poster child for 'support the art not the artist'. I don't understand how an outspoken homophobe wrote this amazing book that champions the power of empathy, but thank goodness for libraries and used book stores so we can still read and enjoy this wonderful book.","Orson Scott Card is an outspoken homophobe who donates to anti-gay causes, so its a pretty natural response to not want to support him financially. Here are a couple quotes from him on the issue:

>""Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down.""  
>  
>""The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.""

So, gross is a bit of an understatement. That said, Ender's Game has an incredibly important message that it would truly be a shame to lose. Thank goodness we're fans of a medium which has options for consuming the art without financially supporting the artist.

If you haven't read the book, here's the setup (no spoilers IMO, back of the book kind of thing, but I'll still put it in black in case you prefer to go in with a blank slate). >!It's the story of Ender Wiggin, a boy who is recruited into the elite orbital Battle School. There, young men and women are trained into the next generation of military leaders to command the forces of humanity against the buggers. The buggers are insect-like aliens who have attempted to invade the solar system twice, nearly wiping out humanity in the most recent invasion, and now humanity is preparing for the next battle.!<

>!Ender is a brilliant, empathetic kid, but has felt mostly alone his entire life. His older brother Peter is a violent sociopath, and only Ender’s older sister Valentine prevented Peter from attacking Ender. Now, at battle school, Ender feels even more alone, surrounded by children older than himself and adults who are constantly pushing him to his limits and trying to force him to be violent in an attempt to either break him or mold him into the best military commander Earth has ever produced.!<

This book is so many wonderful things at once.

First, the core theme of the book is the power of empathy and how, even if you're only goal is to 'succeed' in life, you still should strive to put yourself in other people's shoes. Sure, you need intelligence and drive, but if you truly understand other people and how they think and feel, you'll both be the kind of person other people want to be around and able to understand other people's motivations and values. I don't know about in the rest of the world, but in America we have far too little popular art that highlights the power and importance of empathy - and by showing how empathy is invaluable even to people who only want to 'succeed', I think Card has made a truly unique argument for a habitually undervalued virtue that speaks perfectly to the people who most need to hear it.

The book is also just an unbelievable page turner. It's the classic hero's journey - and Ender is a hero that you absolutely will want to root for. How can you not be on the side of the brilliant, sensitive six year old kid who is taken from his family and put through hell to try and save the whole human race? It's also got one of the best twists of all time, which in addition to blowing your mind on the first read, also brings home subthemes about the importance of communication to avoid conflict, and a general anti-war message as well.

For lots of other kinds of art, its very hard to consume that art without financially supporting the artist. Thank goodness that we have libraries and used book stores, which make it possible to read wonderful books by problematic authors without sending money to that problematic author.

ox7ard,books,"If a fictional universe has dragons and magic in it, there's no real reason it can't also have black people or Asian people in it.","I think the idea of fantasy worlds are so cool. I love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil. It's all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you're too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There's a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there's an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn't sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.

I'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone.

Edit: Quick notes because I got pretty overwhelmed with the response.

* when I say Asian I mean people of Asian decent in the story. Not litterally from Asia in a fictional universe. Like you'd describe Asian coded people in your world like how the shu are described in 6 of crows. Not put Asian products africa in your fantasy world.

* I don't mean only Asian or black people. It's every miniority underrepresented people in fantasy. Gay, Indian, trans, Hispanic etc etc.

* saying ""but what if they changed black Panther white isn't a gotcha. It's a really cliché disengenous argument..

* Diversity doesn't ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn't ever have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people.

* representation is important. Just because you don't personally see the value of it doesn't mean it isn't valuable.

* yes I have read more than one fantasy book. The fact that people would attack me and gatekeep because I haven't read your favorite series is messed up. I'm just as real of a fan as you.

* me making this post isn't forcing diversity down your throat.

* saying I don't want diversity I just want good stories is just telling on yourself. Firstly, wanting both is perfectly okay. Secondly, they aren't mutually exclusive.

* no, ""just imagining the characters as whatever you want"" isn't an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we're talking about.

* asking why people still care about skin color ignores how many people can't choose to ignore their skin color. In America people are still treated differently and have very different lived experiences because of their skin color. Stop saying that like it's a obvious answer it's not and it's off topic.

* no wanting more diversity isn't racist.

* I truly don't care about karma. It can't buy me anything. I never understood reddits obsession with karma. I didn't realize there's an unwritten rule about not crossposting after a certain date.

wdoiq2,books,"In December readers donated over $700,000 to Patrick Rothfuss' charity for him to read a chapter from Doors of Stone with the expectation of ""February at the latest."" He has made no formal update in 8 months.","Just another update that the chapter has yet to be released and Patrick Rothfuss has not posted a blog mentioning it since December. This is just to bring awareness to the situation, please please be respectful when commenting.

For those interested in the full background:

* Each year Rothfuss does a fundraiser through his charity
* Last year he initially set the stretch goal to read the Prologue
* This goal was demolished and he added a second stretch goal to read another chapter
* This second goal was again demolished and he attempted to backtrack on the promise demanding there be a third stretch goal that was essentially ""all or nothing"" (specifically saying, ""I never said when I would release the chapter"")
* After significant backlash his community manager spoke to him and he apologized and clarified the chapter would be released regardless
* He then added a third stretch goal to have a 'super star' team of voice actors narrate the chapter he was planning to release
* This goal was also met and the final amount raised was roughly $1.25 million
* He proceeded to read the prologue shortly after the end of the fundraiser
* He stated in December we would receive the new chapter by ""February at the latest""
* There has been zero official communication on the chapter since then

Some additional clarifications:

* While Patrick Rothfuss does own the charity the money is not held by them and goes directly to (I believe) Heifer International. This is not to say that Rothfuss does not directly benefit from the fundraiser being a success (namely through the fact that he pays himself nearly $100,000 for renting out ~~his home~~ a building he purchased as the charity's HQ aside from any publicity, sponsorships, etc. that he receives). But Rothfuss is by no means pocketing $1.3M and running.
* I believe that Rothfuss has made a few comments through other channels (eg: during his Twitch streams) ""confirming"" that the chapter is delayed but I honestly have only seen those in articles/reddit posts found by googling for updates on my own
* Regarding the prologue, all three books are extremely similar so he read roughly roughly 1-2 paragraphs of new text
* Rothfuss has used Book 3 as an incentive for several years at this point, one example of a previous incentive goal was to stream him writing a chapter (it was essentially a stream of him just typing on his computer, we could not see the screen/did not get any information)

Edit: Late here but for posterity one clarification is that the building rented as Worldbuilder's HQ is not Rothfuss' personal home but instead a separate building that he (""Elodin Holdings LLC"") purchased. The actual figure is about $80,000.

Edit 2: Clarifying/simplifying some of the bullet points."
6gryh0,books,Modern libraries are awesome and deserve a shoutout!,"Last year, I moved to a new city and my first instinct was to pick up a library card from my nearest public library. It's amazing how they have changed with the times! 

My library has three media rooms, a 3D printer (plus classes to take on how to use it), a video production library full of equipment you can check out, a teen game room, yoga classes, small business classes and more. I was really amazed at how much of a central community hub it had become compared to my old public library which was still a bit older and dated. 

You can even check out a kindle while you go on vacation! You can preload books to read and take it with you. Simply return once you get home. Now I live on the road and constantly travel. I use their online catalog to rent ebooks onto my kindle. I literally have a library with me wherever I go! 

I can't overstate how much I love my library! 

Edit: I also wanted to add for those who don't have a kindle, you can download the kindle app to your phone or computer for free! That's what I did before I was gifted my current kindle :)

Double edit: Since some people are curious, my main library is Library21c in Colorado Springs, CO.

Last Edit I promise: User r/Fartin_Van_Buren pointed out to me that the Colorado Library System is set up to receive donations from smile.amazon.com. Just search under ""Pikes Peak Library District"". "

Four full length books are already out with JK Rowling's permission, all completely free!","The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books! Even better!
EDIT: To be clear, JK Rowling gave the author permission to distribute the books for free, but did NOT endorse the series as canon."
e028z1,books,"4 years ago my dad passed away, today I finally receive the first copy of the book he wrote and never dared to publish","First of all, my dad was in love with books, really.. Reading was his life. I didn't know that writing was a part of it too...

4 years ago, I was 22, he passed away. Few months after that my mom gave me a 150 pages of text and told me it was written by my dad and one of his guilty dream was to some day be published. 

It took me few weeks, maybe months, to finally read it, some handwritten notes from my mom was also in the text, it was like I was having a last discussion with my dad. I decided to do everything I could to publish it even at a really small scale. 

At the beginning of this year my mom passed away too (she never really recovered from the loss of my father), I’m sad that I never had the chance to offer her one copy of the book, but today is a big achievement in my life and I wanted to tell my story here and share it with you, because a lot of my motivation and energy came from all the reddit community, so thank you everyone here for being such an awesome community.

EDIT: WOW! You guys are all amazing! Thank you so much for the support! Thank you for your kind words! Thank you for the platinum, gold and silver!! 

A lot of you asked where you can buy it, for the moment.. nowhere I made some copies by myself! Next step is to find a way to publish it and propose it in store :)

I’m french so the book is in French so if anyone here speak/read French, I will be honored to find a way to send you a copy when I’ll have more available! 

Many of you asked for the synopsis, it’s a novel, the story of a boy who lost his father in an accident, and few years later her mom died because of sadness of her loss (yes. It looks like my own life I swear to god that it’s incredibly weird but 100% true) and the book is about the life of this boy and how he will fall in love with books, books will save and maybe destroy him at the same time. 

I’ll try to answer to everyone, thank you so much again for your kindness and support!

EDIT 2: I saw some people talking about sales strategy... I swear it’s 100% true. 
And I want to say something: everyone here who wants a copy will have one for free (maybe digital one because I don’t have a lot of copies..) I don’t want to earn money from this, your support and kindness already help me so much, you can’t even imagine"

vy6jeu,books,Has Stephen King always put weirdly sexual things into his books or did I just stumble onto two that happened to have it?,"*SPOILER* I read Billy Summers a couple months ago and really liked the parental, father/daughter vibe I THOUGHT I was getting from the relationship of the two main characters, until the young woman (19/20) ends up falling in love with the 45 year old (!!!) man. 

And now I am halfway through Firestarter which I believe is a new release and once again there is a grown man, developing a weird romantic relationship with an 8 year old! 

Such a shame because I really enjoyed both books up until he introduced this point. In both books it literally adds nothing to the plot, the storyline would have been literally unchanged if he kept it non-romantic/sexual. I was planning on reading more of his books but after these two I am probably going to give up.

Edit: did not expect this to blow up! From the sounds of it this is a recurring theme throughout his books so I will be taking him off my future reads. 

Also my mistake, someone pointed out that Firestarter is not new; the copy that I bought had a newer cover and I had never heard of it before so I assumed it was a new release.

Edit2: some of you are really upset over the fact that I don’t enjoy reading about childrens sexual activity/descriptions of peoples genitals/whatever other weird stuff King includes….are you guys ok?? 

And also big shoutout to the person who felt the need to message me privately that I must be a new reader since I didn’t know Firestarter was released in 1980. Hope you find something more productive to do with the rest of your day."

&#x200B;

(Personal Bias) Its in the format I like.  I prefer blog post summaries to extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a four course entree which ends up boring you. I can put this down and go to something else rather easily. This book is not a 4 hour course at a specialty cruise.  It's a row of specialty snacks...loosely arranged in the order it wants you to partake in them. You have quite a bit of personal choice in how you want to read this.

&#x200B;

The short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    The wide variety of individuals with different jobs, backgrounds, and personalities have actually reminded me of the book ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.

&#x200B;

The best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military(At least, during the initial spreading outbreak).  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Quite a few of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them of home life perks.   People get saved.  I ""liked"" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine and raked in millions.  People gradually turn into metaphorical monsters in order to fend off material monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense. Oh, and the ""individual outpost"" military stories are actually also well done.

&#x200B;

Oh, and it has its cheery moments too! People reminding others to stay alive and upbeat.  People going back risking themselves to save others.  After the ""victory"" life seems to go back to normal...albeit a vastly reduced population and quite different architectural standards to ward off zombies. I would love to see a drawup of the new ""anti-zombie"" architecture ubiquitous in every city.

&#x200B;

One of the few 5/5 fictional books I have read in quite awhile! If you didn't know in advance that the Zombie genre simply has never done the ""military vs initial outbreak"" successfully you may rank it lower.  Instead, you simply have to take that as a given. Engage your suspension of disbelief for some key common and necessary tropes and this \*actually\* ends up fairly realistic.

&#x200B;

Here is a nice quote.

&#x200B;

""In the beginning everyone was friendly. We cooperated. We traded or even bought what we needed from other families. Money was still worth something. Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon. Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they’d always leave me with a neighbor. I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night. It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded. We’d listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from. I’d sit on Dad’s lap. “See,” he’d say, “they didn’t get out in time. They weren’t smart like us.” He’d try to force a smile. For a little while, I thought he was right. But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean. There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing. The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore. A couple times I stepped in human shit. Nobody was even bothering to bury it."""

[A poem by](/r/books/comments/2ysvzb/terry_pratchett_has_died_megathread/cpcp6bg) /u/Poem_for_your_sprog


The sun goes down upon the Ankh,  
And slowly, softly fades -  
Across the Drum; the Royal Bank;  
The River-Gate; the Shades.

A stony circle's closed to elves;  
And here, where lines are blurred,  
Between the stacks of books on shelves,  
A quiet '*Ook*' is heard.

A copper steps the city-street  
On paths he's often passed;  
The final march; the final beat;  
The time to rest at last.

He gives his badge a final shine,  
And sadly shakes his head -  
While Granny lies beneath a sign  
That says: 'I aten't dead.'

The Luggage shifts in sleep and dreams;  
It's now. The time's at hand.  
For where it's always night, it seems,  
A timer clears of sand.

And so it is that Death arrives,  
When all the time has gone...  
But dreams endure, and hope survives,  
And Discworld carries on.

gz26ts,books,"I'm a 23 year old, straight man who has recently fallen in love with contemporary romance novels and I think that it is important for other men to try them as well. Here's why.","I didn't know quite where else to discuss this, but I needed to get off this my chest and felt this would be a supportive community. In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19. Days melded together and genuine human connection had become next to impossible as everything went virtual. For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.

Like many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words. This can be seen in nearly every form of media/entertainment focused on male audiences from books, movies, and TV all the way to advertisements.  I would always find myself overwhelmed by the overly masculine protagonists that kicked ass and who's entire character development never centered around their growth with another individual in a romantic nature. Romantic partners were often seen as a plus to have, but never a key component to the growth of the protagonist. For this reason, when a romance took place and offered itself as a core part of the characters growth, it felt refreshing and always made me feel much better as a result (there are so few examples that I can't even think of one off the top of my head even now). Eventually, I realized that there was, in fact, a genre that offered this satisfaction, but not as a side note, as the main purpose of the story: romance.

Similar to the stigma that men should hide their emotions, I always felt that there was this unsaid truth that romance novels just weren't for men and those who read them often did so privately out of the desire to not be ridiculed or look unmasculine. Similarly, romance novels, at least these days, are thought to simply be erotica which older women can read in public (looking at you ***50 Shades***). These misconceptions has prevented me from trying them for many years as a result, something that I now feel was a missed opportunity for many more years of pleasure reading.

The book that changed this, as mentioned above, was ***The Kiss Quotient*** by Helen Hoang. This is a story of an autistic woman who hires a male escort to teach her how to be a more romantic person and be more skilled at sex. Naturally, as the story progresses, they learn more about each other and fall in love, despite their difference in social class, wealth, and family trauma. What I loved about the story was not the world, which often led me to other genre's like fantasy, but the characters. While many books focused on male audiences often offer huge casts of characters which have minimal change over the story, this book and many of it's peers had a small cast which gave the writer a chance to highlight their growth on a personal level in greater depth in less time than in huge series such as ***Harry Potter***, where Harry has very little growth in 7 large books (don't get be wrong, I love the series, but I'd hazard a guess that like many others it was due to the interesting world and huge cast of colorful, albeit flat, characters).

I have since devoured several other contemporary romance novels, each time enjoying the emotional character depth present for the two leads. However, the ever present stigmas have prevented me, until now, from really discussing the novels with other people, which as many of you know is half the fun of reading anything. This isolation has made me feel the need to write this post. I feel that there are many others out there that, similar to me, really want something that can provide some emotional based story telling and I believe that romance novels can provide just this.

Now don't get me wrong, these novels do suffer from similar problems in representation regarding men that other genres have towards women. For example, while many TV shows, movies, and books show women as physical goddess that can have the emotional complexity of a hunk of wood, romance novels often depict men as physical machines that have muscles so hard  you could shatter concrete against them while also being gods at sex. This can be very disheartening for male readers, as they can have an inferiority complex and can give the impression that this demigod form is needed to find the emotional happiness depicted in the stories. However, I believe that this provides men a chance to understand and sympathize with the way many women feel about how they are represented in nearly everything else! The solution to improve this stigma in romance novels is the same one needed to fix how women are depicted: more male writers. This in turn can only be done if romance gains a higher male readership who would demand more accurate representation.

In conclusion, I feel that more male readers should give romantic novels a try. It's my firm belief that similar to me, many would actually find a new medium that can proved emotional satisfaction that is so often left out in other genres despite the fact that romance is something nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. Further more, it has opened my eyes wider to the pressure that women feel in from other media to accept the idea that your physique is core to your happiness, and understand how degrading it can be.

Thank you to everyone that read this entire ramble. I have been needing to get this off my chest for some time and I hope that this gave you some food for thought.

**EDIT:** I really want to thank everyone for all their support and recommendations! It really has meant a lot to see. I have been trying to comment on as many things as I've had time to and I will continue to do so, but please excuse me if I don't get the chance to read what you have to say :(. Also thank your for my first ever gold reward!

**EDIT 2:** At the request of some, I've written a *TLDR*

**TLDR**; Men should try romance novels in spite of social stigma's against displaying emotion as they offer highly satisfying character growth, but also provide a means to experience the inferiority women feel in other genres which can yield much needed shift towards true character representation in all forms of media.

**EDIT 3:** I really want to thank everyone again for their support and suggestions! I just wanted to comment on something that many people have been recommending to me, which is to try watching romance anime and manga. I love romance anime and manga! One reason that I discovered my love of romance in general started when I watch the anime movie **Your Name**. However, as I pointed out to one user, the thing that pushed me towards American romance novels was a significant lack of physical intimacy that is present in Japanese story telling. This is a result of the differences in culture and simply comes with the territory, but as a result, few stories have intimacy present prior to the final chapters or episodes. Also since it was a key topic in my essay, I should also mention that many Japanese anime and manga don't really help with the issues of normal physique in regards to women and can often have some very sexist caricatures of women that I honestly have been getting tired of. That being said, I do appreciate the recommendations and am loving the discussions that are taking place in the comments section!"

kx1jih,books,Unpopular Opinion: Jumping between different characters on each chapter is just annoying.,"Probably going to get downvoted for this, but I seriously dislike when authors jump between different characters storylines in each chapter. I don’t have a great memory so I spend a lot of the time trying to remember where they left off. Also, sometimes I don’t like the character or their storyline, but I have to read through it to get to the storyline of the one(s) I do care about, which are normally the ones I chose to read the book for. 

I’ve been reading Red Rising, the first three books were phenomenal. The author didn’t jump between characters, it was just the one characters POV and I loved it. Now on the fourth book, 5% in and there’s already three characters to keep up with! I only care about the one from the first three books, that’s why I decided to read the fourth!"

I hadn't read anything from this author. From the moment I started the book, it was awful, like a high schooler's first attempt at a novel.

I kept reading until I reached this paragraph: ""Maybe he hadn't gone too far. Maybe he wasn't in deep doodoo. Who knows, he might even get to screw her"" on page 8. I closed the book and can't wait to re-donate it back to the library - at least they'll make another dollar if it sells again.

Anyway, the point is I always see posts about people who want to know how far in a book they should read before giving up. My advice: when you're not enjoying it. That's when you stop. Life is just too damn short to read a book that you're not enjoying (unless, of course, it's for a school assignment).

As my mother, her support for me was unconditional — she taught me to embrace my dreams, reject conformity and challenge the dark voices of fear and self-doubt. As a writer, she taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions.

As she kissed Anne goodbye, her younger sister Karen said, ""What a ride you took us on, kid."" I think we can all agree.

-He’s been keeping the list since he was a sophomore in college

-No he doesn’t have a favorite, he laughed and said there’s no way to pick

-he’s read a total of 2,891 (approx)

-The numbers next to the title is the amount read for that year, I think the max he read in a year was 71

-he’s reread about 10% of the list

-He was an editor at a newspaper

Edit 2: Ok, so here is every page of the list: https://imgur.com/gallery/pIpRZDk

bimjpa,books,Have you ever stopped listening to an audiobook because the tone of the narrator was so annoying.,"I did that last week with *[The Life Changing Art of Tidying Up](https://archive.org/details/Marie.Kondo..The.LifeChanging.Magic.of.Tidying.Up..audiobook..004)*

It's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.

But by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.

There are actually two reasons why I quit this book:

1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)

2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.

Combine these both and it was a real irritating experience to listen to this book. So, I told myself: *fuck it,* and scrapped the folder from my phone.

Did any of you ever had this sort of experience with an audiobook before?

**EDIT:** I really hope and pray that the audiobook producers and voice actors out there come across our discussion here so that they get a greater awareness on our concerns, and work towards providing better quality audiobooks for us all.  Peace!"

So for those with the ability to visualize, does it just happen as you quickly as you read? Or does it happen more after the fact as you recall characters and events?

It seemed so boring to me and I was constantly getting distracted. I'd read a whole page but wouldn't understand anything I've read, and thought I hated reading. It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. 

Some time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air"", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.

Before I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.

I found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. 

I looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World. 

I never thought I'd ever enjoy reading on my own time, but now I can see why people love books so much. Thank you guys for recommending and discussing great books, and for reading my post! Have a great day! "
p6wozu,books,"CS Lewis' dedication in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is superb."," ""My Dear Lucy,

The stages of liking, outgrowing, and returning to fairy tales is a comment that resonated with how I've been reading of late. I have been revisiting the books that I read back in school, those that I grew up with. I realise that perhaps I could not have enjoyed these even a few years earlier, and yet, having reached a certain age (how wonderfully Lewis leaves that open-ended), I'm realising that despite what is often said, these are, in fact, stories that I can return to, no matter how much my age may supposedly separate me from the maturity that these books express. Of course, part of returning is a way of feeding nostalgia, but I have also been feeling that these books still have things to give. They have not been exhausted."

My point, however, is that if you are an author and want your work to become more than fan fiction, using names that are hard to remember and pronounce goes against your goal. Is it acceptable for you that people don’t remember the names of the places and people you spent hours, days, or weeks fleshing out? It shouldn’t. Would you feel better if your readers saw the ridiculous names, and then made their own versions of those names, because your names are so outlandish, that the readers refuse to play along?

Like so many other teenage girls in high school, I had to read and relate to 95% male-centric stories written by men. I never questioned why we were reading so many “boy books” because the books were not presented as ""boy books,"" they were just presented as normal literature. The curriculum at my school allowed for just a smidgeon of diversity with *Pride and Prejudice* and *The Scarlet Letter*. This was never seen as an issue; it’s just how it was. I still remember clearly hearing the boys in my small class groaning about having to read a “girl book” when we started *Pride and Prejudice*. The fact that the author was a woman or the main characters women or some combination of those two facts in the boys’ minds was enough to make them sneer at it. It was mildly annoying then, but deeply infuriating and sad now looking back on it years later. Maybe, just maybe, if some of the great female authors and female-centric stories that have been written throughout history had been a part of our Literature curriculums starting from a young age and this was presented as NORMAL, we wouldn’t have high school boys joking and sneering at having to read a “girl book.”

You can see the same scenario when men discover that movies like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde are, in fact, great movies. There was a post like this too recently on the movies subreddit. “I didn’t think I would like a chick flick, but it’s actually really good!” Turns out that women are just people, and stories about them and the things they go through are equally as valid and worthy of being told. What a mind-blowing concept!

The way these statements are phrased as such delightful revelations makes me cringe, and then I feel sad, and then I feel a bit angry, because on some level, whether subconsciously or consciously, the driving force behind these sentiments and posts is that women are “other.” They are not the standard human, they are not fully-fledged standard human people in the same way that men are, so their stories and stories written by them are a sort of “special interest” sub-category of women’s fiction. “Girl books.” “Woman’s book.” “Chick-flicks.” 

Consider this hypothetical scenario and how utterly ludicrous it sounds to us:

*”As a middle-aged woman, I didn’t think I would be able to enjoy *Lord of the Flies*. I don’t know what it’s like to be a boy so I didn’t think I could possibly relate to these characters and their struggles, but I actually really enjoyed it! Even though it’s about male characters, I found the story to be really great overall and dealing with deep themes. It’s not just a boy book, it’s great literature!”*

See? Sounds pretty damn ridiculous, doesn’t it? 

Girls and women are perfectly capable of viewing male-authored/male-centric stories as just normal good literature because that is the way it is presented to us from a young age all the way up to older education. This is how we are conditioned (with no real choice in the matter), while boys and men are never forced to view female-authored/female-centric stories the same way. 

So, next time you see on of these posts, I’m not calling for us to be rude and antagonistic to the OPs, because what they are doing is technically good I suppose, but I dislike the way they are wanting a pat on the back and upvotes simply for viewing women’s stories as good valid literature worthy of being read.

It is sad and disturbing that women continue to be seen as the “other” in fiction, a sub-category separate from the established standard of “good literature.” 

There is no logical reason other than deeply engrained misogyny in society why a man should be that surprised that *Little Women* is a good book. It’s sold millions of copies, had tons of adaptations, is extremely well-known and deeply beloved by people all over the globe. It should not be that surprising that this “women’s book” is in fact, just a good piece of literature regardless of the gender of author or characters. Women are literally just people, and their stories are equally as worthy of being told and read as male stories. We are all part of the same humanity. 

The sentiment of “Wow, this isn’t just for women, it’s actually a good story!” carries the not-so-subtle implication that things that are “for women” are inherently lesser. They are seen as a separate sub-category other than the standard that can sometimes achieve “great literature” status despite their femaleness. The surprise expressed by men who find these stories to be great implies that their perception shifted, they believed something about the “women’s book” before, and now believe something different having read it.

I am 25 now, so I don't know how things are in high schools nowadays. For anyone who does know, are the English Lit curriculums more balanced now or is it still the vast majority of male author/male story? I'm very curious to know. 

I want to hear your thoughts on this matter.

“Right, I doubt anyone is sorting by new here anymore but SO many people are missing the point of this post.

OP is not ""discouraging"" men from reading women's literature. Read the post again. She is focusing specifically on the idea that, from a man's perpsective, women's literature being good is surprising, so surprising that it warrants a post on how surprising it is. That the expectation that women's literature (and art in general) is so much lesser than men's that it becomes a shock when a man reads it and enjoys it.

It is NOT OP's responsibility to ""encourage men"" to read women's books. The fact that so many men are unwilling to read women's literature is an issue brought about by patriarchal assumptions that men should be sorting out, not women. Women don't need to hold our hands, guide us to all the great female writers, pat us on the back and give us a gold star when we enjoy it. It is not their responsibility. It is ours as men.

OP should not be praising these men. In fact OP, along with the rest of us, should be criticising these mindsets. We should look at these posts through a critical lens, otherwise how are we supposed to move forward? There are plenty of people on this comment section who would much rather OP kept quiet and that the issue is never highlighted or solved, simply because it might be too upsetting for men to read. If you're a man and that's really how you respond when reading this post, grow up.”"

i3o5uz,books,I just finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time... I'm at a loss for words,"Wow. Just wow. I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."""

os6c9f,books,What book made you go: ''Fuck... This is good...''?,"I'm not a big reader. I just read a few books every year. 4 years ago I was browsing my local bookstore and no book caught my eye. The bookstore owner asked what my favorite childhood book was and I said that I always loved Harry Potter. He then recommended The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss saying that I will like that book since it's Harry Potter for adults. (He didn't mention that the series wasn't finished yet...)

I vividly remember reading it with so much joy! Every chapter kept getting better and better. It was the first time in my life that a book actually gave me a 'wow' moment. I just didn't know a book could be that beautiful.

It's been awhile since I read a book like that. I've read some really good books but nothing spectacular.

Have you ever got that feeling and what book was it?

**EDIT:**
Wow, what a way to wake up! I'm currently reading 'Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Thief' by Maurice Leblanc (Which is really fun), but I've got some good suggestions what to read next!

- [Shōgun by James Clavell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52382796-sh-gun): I've never read anything placed in Japan, but it looks really good! I have no idea how I'm going to find a copy of that though...

- [The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora): It's been on my ""Want to read""-list for so long now! Apparently the friendship and banter between the two main characters is phenomenally written. I've searched for this book for a long time, but there doesn't seem to be a Dutch translated version of it and my library where I currently can't go to doesn't have the English version...

- [East of Eden by John Steinbeck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden): I've heard so many good things about it, but it seems so biblical to me... Maybe I should read it with an open mind?

- [Pillars of The Earth by Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth): Like East of Eden, I don't know if this book is for me, but who knows?

- [Dune by Frank Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune): I would love to read this, but sadly my bookstore will probably only sell it when the actual Dune movie comes out, with a bookcover that looks like the movieposter. :/

- [The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo): I *need* that book in my life!


There are of course a whole lot of other suggestions, but since I'm not the biggest reader, these books seem like a good way to start (for me atleast)!

I also think that I need to move to another country. I don't seem to be able to find the books I truely want to read... The books I do find, are expensive and badly translated. Don Quixote costed me a fortune (as a student), just because it was translated (it was hilarious though)."

BEEP BEEP BEEP scanners all over the damn place, and none of them even give a shit about the books. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s great that the library probably makes a little more than it would otherwise, but these people really rubbed me the wrong way. 

It would be nice if they at least said something like “no scanners allowed for the first hour.” That way actual readers like myself could go through and find the books we’d like to read, then they can run around scanning for whatever rando copies of books will make them extra cash.

I couldn't help but find myself very attached to his character and rooting for him tremendously from front cover to back.

8glkbk,books,"I bought the same book i sold almost 5 years ago, and I found my mother's last words to me.","Some may find this as crazy as I did. It's a little long but it's worth it 

My mother and father divorced in 2010, this is when my mother began doing meth. She was in an out of jail a couple times and in febuary of 2013 my mom commited suicide in her jail cell. No letter was ever left. No final goodbye to her 14 year old daughter. Nothing just silence. I may have discovered the last thing my mother ever left to me. So get this... when my mom went to prison the first time she was there for 9 months. After she got out she gave me a bag of books to read. Books that might help me get why she was there.  Or things she thought i would love. She would read them and highlight specific passages in pink highlighter. Things she wanted to say to me but didn't know how.  One of those books was the house of leaves. It was nibbled on in the right corner and had some paint on it. I carried the book for a while but never read it due to its complexity. I sold it to half price books on hulen in 2014. Last week i went to the half price books in Arlington one I had never been to. I bought the house of leaves. And it too was nibbled on in the right corner and had paint. I shrugged it off doubting it could possibly be the same book. I started reading it and now I can't seem to stop. There have been more than a few coincidences at this point. I started skimming thru the book out of boredom... and I found passages highlighted in pink... and one of the passages read.. ""I took my morning walk, I took my evening walk, I ate something, I thought about something, I wrote something, I napped and I dreamt something too, and with all that something, I still have nothing because so much of sum'things has always been and always will be you.
I miss you."" 



It may just be coincidence however I'm going to believe that somehow she knew I needed comfort. And somehow she got this book back to me."

gvt82y,books,"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points.","I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism’s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

Update: hold your keyboard if you're going to accuse me of generalizing english teachers, you're just gonna make yourself look like a chucklehead. Who should I blame for Walden being mis-taught? The math teachers?

Just ridiculous."" So thank you for keeping me from successfully being gaslighted (gaslit?... Gaslighted...? Gaslighted. Yeah.)"
9it4if,books,I just finished reading all of the Sci-Fi on Reddit's 200 most recommended books,"I have always been a sci-fi fan, but it always bothered me whenever I saw a list of the best Sci-Fi (according to whoever) and I'd read (or even heard of) so few of them. Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!

About 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!

I just wanted to mark the occasion by sharing some thoughts, joys, and disappointments with everyone here:

**A Fire Upon the Deep** Is an absolute stand out. I had no idea what to expect. I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.

**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.

**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. 

**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.

**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.

**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. 

Thanks for reading my mini treatise :)

My 84 year old grandfather is writing a novel, and has asked me to help edit it and give ""candid comments."" I'm 100 pages in, and objectively, it's a terrible book. The writing is bad, the dialogue is completely unbelievably, as are the characters, the story is uninteresting, the chronology is all confused, etc. I have literally nothing good to say about it.

My grandfather is a very smart man (attended Columbia and Yale), and he thinks very highly of himself and his writing abilities. He refuses to take a writing course or join a writer's workshop (""Why would I do that? I know how to write!""), and I know that he's going to ask me about it, expecting a glowing review. And I don't know what to do.

On the one hand, it'll never get published so it kind of doesn't matter if I tell him it's great to make him feel good. On the other hand, he does want to write something good, and I don't want to completely lie to him.

Anyone out there ever experienced something similar, or have any advice? Much appreciated :)

Edits:
1. Holy crap Reddit, thanks for all the responses! I really appreciate all the input, and couldn't have ever imagined that this would make it to the front page of Reddit.
2. The book is about four boys on a baseball team who become friends, and the ways that their lives remain entwined in their adulthood.
3. Part of the problem is that my grandfather did publish a novel a few years ago, which is partly where his ego in relation to his writing ability comes from. It wasn't great, but it was better.
4. I think what I'll most likely do is a combination of your various advice: lie a bit about it being better than it is, then soften my main criticisms as much as possible. Again, thanks to everyone! "

I don't always have the budget to buy a brand new book, or the time and energy to find a good epub version of my to-read books but the library is a place I can go to and get free books at my leisure, FREE. Most of the time I can extend my loan and have the books for over a month. 

I don't know why people don't read more, it shuts down my crazy mind and allows for another world, another view, to take over for awhile and to me, that's freedom.

hup36z,books,I'm dyslexic so reading has always been hard for me. I read half of a book to completion for the first time in my life yesterday and it felt amazing.,"I'm 35 years old and have struggled with dyslexia and ADD my whole life.  Reading for more than 20-30 minutes at a time often becomes both physically and mentally distressing for me.  I often have to re-read entire paragraphs or pages because I was thinking about something else, or I will mis-read a word that changes the sentence and confuses the hell out of me.  My eyes will often cross or go blurry which can sometimes lead to headaches.  Because of this, reading an entire novel will typically take me weeks or months to complete. 

Yesterday I sat and read the entire 2nd half of The Eighth Guardian by Merideth McCardle in a single sitting and it felt amazing.  Her 1st person writing style kept my ADD in check as it was constantly on to the next revelation, or experience, without feeling hectic.  I was so thoroughly engaged in the story of time travelling spies that I immediately went and bought the other two in the series.  Dyslexia still reared it's ugly head a few times but I was able to power through it for the first time in my life. 

After feeling like giving up on reading so many times in my life, it seems that all it took was the right book to make me realize that I could do it too."
abcux9,books,"On January 1, 2019 for the first time in more than 20 years, copyrighted works will enter the public domain. Here is how to use your send to kindle email address to add free ebooks from Project Gutenberg (or elsewhere) to your kindle library","The good news here is you only have to set this up one time - it is rather confusing and many many people miss the step of whitelisting the email they will be using to send books to their kindle. 

If you want to find more free ebooks or see what is uploaded to public domain sources over the next few days subscribe to r/FreeEBOOKS.

[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.

Ebooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. 



Please ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. 


# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address

First you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it’s way easier to find on your kindle.  


**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**


Harder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> 

https://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg

 


under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” -> 

https://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png

 


Click “Devices” in the menu near the top ->

https://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png

 


click the “…” next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  

https://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png

 


(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have “devices” going back for many years of phones) 

Your send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com



 

# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.

 

On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click “Account & Lists” -> 

https://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg

 

under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” ->

https://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png




click “Preferences"" in the top bar of that page -> 

https://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png

 

Click “Personal Document Settings” -> 

https://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png

 

find “Approved Personal Document E-mail List” on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  

https://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png




# 3 - Let’s send a book.  

 

Go to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. 

https://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png

 

Now open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  

Go to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  

I typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.

6p30xp,books,I make posters with quotes from classic books. Tell me what you think?,"Final Edit: I'm not allowed to post my site here due to self-promotion rules, so PM me if you want a link.

Hi all, after looking for gifts for book-lovers and not finding what I was after, I decided to take action with some of my own ideas. I wanted to make something that didn't look like everything else on Etsy, etc. [Here's an imgur gallery of the posters I came up with](http://www.imgur.com/a/GNVnD). I'm looking for any feedback you guys have. These are the first nine, but hopefully there are more to come. If you've got suggestions for great quotes, I would also love to hear those too. Thanks for looking!

Edit: Wow this blew up. A couple things:

1) Thanks for all the nice comments!

2) I should have mentioned that these are all in the public domain. Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to make posters for more recent books :( Thank you for all the quote recommendations though. I'm building up a reading list off of some of those alone."

jc1p93,books,“Atlas Shrugged” Really Isn’t All That Great,"Let me explain.

I’ve been reading about 50 pages of it a day for a while now, and I gotta day, it’s not all that it’s acclaimed to be.

It’s not that I don’t dislike the ideology, per say. I mean, I don’t prescribe to Ayn Rand’s world views, but that’s not the reason I don’t like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It’s just that she’s so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that’s the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.

If you want me to believe what you’re writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with “Fahrenheit 451”. The world feels natural, as does the message.

For “Atlas Shrugged”, though, it’s just not. The line between good and bad is so black-and-white it’s cliche, and not in a clever way either.  All the characters speak in the same way too. They literally sound like they’re all the same person. Furthermore, it’s not just that the characters sound the same; all the protagonists practically have the same features!

I’m going to describe a character, and you’re going to have to tell me which one it is: They’re gaunt, have steely blue eyes, and a cold demeanor. Who is it? You can’t tell me, can you. THEYRE ALL THE SAME. 

It’s really frustrating because people kept telling me how good this book was going to be. I usually love political-fiction. It’s my favorite genre, in fact. So why is this so terrible? I mean, I’ve kept reading because it’s so bad it’s almost kind of good, but then it just keeps going back to bad. I’m honestly disappointed."

Are these sorts of reactions to smut inserts common? You also see this sort of stuff in TV shows frequently."
4y4wqn,books,"Does anyone else feel the need to rush through action scenes in books in fear of ""losing the moment""?","Whenever I get to the climax of an action scene in a book, I start reading it really really fast to follow the same pace as the fight/discussion is suppose to take. I get myself skipping sentences, or even paragraphs at times, if in the middle of a crucial dialogue, the narrator starts describing the body language of the characters or things that come to their minds. 

I sometimes miss on essential information because of that and I have to go back when I finish reading a chapter to get a fuller picture of what just happened. Does anyone else do the same? If so, what are your  strategies for dealing with the ""extra"" information (i.e. sentences other than the dialogue or description of fight) when reading an action scene for the first time?

EDIT: I'm really glad I'm not the only one who does this."

&nbsp;

* *The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.* - A critique of political office as old as the office itself
* *The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.* - A great early example of the unexpected to come
* *He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.* - This one always seemed to show a great understanding of some of the illogical parts of modern idicum.
* *This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world.* - I don't actually know why I like this one so much!
* *Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.* - Something that can resonate with everyone"

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave, and says ""Hi Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?""

Daves wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.

Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her.

He tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it.

55gonm,Jokes,My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'"

xzv5lm,Jokes,"8 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. I reposted it 4 years ago. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death."""

6nb0uo,Jokes,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

abxd7g,Jokes,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

Before he faces his sentence, he's offered a last meal, and asks for a single banana, which is given to him.  The next day, he's led to the electric chair.  They strap him in, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.

There's never been a failure before.  But because you cannot punish a person twice for the same crime, the court is forced to let him go free.

Within a week's time, naturally, the man, who is obsessed with trains, goes and steals another one.  He doesn't care that he can't drive it or that he failed catastrophically before; he is obsessed with trains and his only desire is to operate one.  As before, he crashes it, and kills several people.  Again, he stands trial, and again, he is sentenced to death, showing no remorse, only delight that he got to operate the train.

His last meal request is a single banana.

When he goes to the chair, the executioner pulls the switch, but nothing happens.  He goes free again.

The train-obsessed maniac, once more on the loose, wastes no time in hijacking a train and crashing it.

His trial is speedy, because this has already happened twice, and he is sentenced to death.  They ask him what he'd like for his last meal.

""A single banana,"" he says.

""Oh, no you don't, you son of a bitch.  We're on to you, now.  We know all about your little banana trick, and you're not escaping this time!"" The guards refuse his request, and instead serve him a standard last meal of steak, potatoes, and berry cobbler.

The next morning they strap him into the electric chair, pull the switch, and... nothing happens.

""*Did you give him the banana?*"" demands the head guard.

""No, sir!  He asked for the banana but we didn't give it to him, we swear!"" says one of the guards.

Turns out the banana had nothing to do with anything.  He was just a really bad conductor."

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.
When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally

decided I needed a girl with some excitement.
When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She
rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad
impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun
initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl
with some real ambition.
When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly

took everything I owned.

One day Sid revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Nathan


the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Sid to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Sid readily agreed to the scheme.


The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.


Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised that only the saliva of Sid would work as the antidote to cure the itch.


The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Sid to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Sid worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Sid left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Three explorers get lost in a huge jungle. After wandering around for days, they are found and captured by a jungle tribe. The tribesmen take the explorers to their leader and drop them at his feet. The chieftain looks at them for a moment and says, “ The three of you will die unless you manage to do a near impossible task. Each of you must gather 10 fruits of the same kind and bring them to me.”
The explorers cannot believe their luck at being given such an easy task. They set out their separate ways to find a fruit as fast as they can. The first one finds an apple tree and so quickly gathers 10 of them. The second one finds some cherries and plucks a bunch of them.They rush to the chieftain and present the fruits. The chieftain smiles and says, “ Now you must shove them up your ass one by one, and if you make any noise or facial expression I will slit your throat right here.”
The first explorer,resigned to his fate, puts on a brave face and starts shoving the apples. He gets to four and then he can’t take it anymore. As soon as he yells in despair, the chieftain takes his knife and slits his throat leaving him to bleed out on the ground.
The first explorer dies and reaches the gates of heaven, and while he is walking in he sees the second explorer running to catch up with him. “Why are you here? I thought you only had ten small cherries with you?” The first guy asks him.
The second explorer laughs and says “ Well all was going fine and I was just sliding the ninth cherry inside, but then I saw our friend dragging a cart of the largest pineapples have seen behind him and I burst out laughing!”"

dxsoki,Jokes,Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf."

7dylhe,Jokes,There was this tramp.,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL.........

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said

He then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it. 

So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything."" 

So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. 

""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here."" 

And the gorilla says, ""At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised."""

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.
I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The devil led him to the door of the next room.
In it was Al Gore with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No, this is no good; I've got his problem with my shoulder.
I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door. Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.


Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""


The devil smiled and said..........

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!""

The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?

He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""

He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy..."" the third guy replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."""

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.""

So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.

She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.

She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.

They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.

She smiles, and says, ""I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.""

The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.

Only this time, she plays left-handed.

The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.

They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out.

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous."" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

The guys think this is hysterical.

Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""What if it's pointing straight up?""

She says, ""Then, I'm fifteen minutes late."""

No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.

""Here,"" he said to the 'statue', ""eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths' for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water.""

9mrfjy,Jokes,"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death."""

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

 They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose.   
 

They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.

id8zqd,Jokes,The first female president,"
The year is 2028 and the United States has elected the first woman as well as the first Jewish president, Sarah Goldstein.

She calls up her mother a few weeks after Election Day and says, ""So, Mom, I assume you'll be coming to my inauguration?""

""I don't think so. It's a ten-hour drive, your father isn't as young as he used to be, and my arthritis is acting up again.""

""Don't worry about it, Mom, I'll send Air Force One to pick you up and take you home. And a limousine will pick you up at your door.""

""I don't know. Everybody will be so fancy-schmantzy; what on earth would I wear?

Sarah replies, ""I'll make sure you have a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in New York.""

""Honey,"" Mom complains, ""you know I can't eat those rich foods you and your friends like to eat.""

The President-to-be responds, ""Don't worry Mom. The entire affair is going to be handled by the best caterer in New York; kosher all the way Mom, I really want you to come.""

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2029, Sarah Goldstein is being sworn in as President of the United States. In the front row sits the new President's mother, who leans over to a senator sitting next to her and says, ""You see that woman over there with her hand on the Torah, becoming President of the United States?""

The senator whispers back, ""Yes, I do.""

Mom says proudly, ""Her brother is a doctor.""

Edit: Dates (the attention to detail in the comments is amazing. Sarah Goldstein would hire you all).

“What’s for dinner honey?”

No answer. He moves closer.

hm635l,Jokes,My late Grandfathers favorite joke,"There was an American wrestler from Texas named John, who throughout his high school career had never lost a match. As he went on into college he continued undefeated. He became a national icon and symbol of American strength.

News began to circulate of a Russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. As each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, America versus Russia. The match would be held in Texas.

John began training immediately. Every day his coach would tell him, “This Russian has a move called the Mongolian Death Grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian Death Grip. DO NOT let him get you in the Mongolian Death Grip”

The day of the match finally came. Just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, “Whatever you do, do not let him get you in the Mongolian death grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian death grip”. 

Four seconds into the match, the Russian had the American in the Mongolian death grip. The coach buried his face into his hands and cursed John for not listening to his advice. All of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of USA USA USA. He looked up and saw the Russian pinned by John. The coach ran out to meet John and embarrassingly told him, “I didn’t see... Once he had you in the Mongolian Death Grip I looked away. How in the world did you get out of the Mongolian death grip?”

With heavy breath, John told him “Well coach, that Russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways I never imagined possible. I was wincing in pain when I open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. So I bit them.”

“What???” Said the coach... “John I don’t think that is legal. You could be disqualified”

“I don’t know about that coach. But I can tell you one thing. You ain’t got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own balls”
